## Installation

```sh
npm install @lomray/react-native-apple-music
```
```sh
npx pod-install
```

### iOS Requirements
- Ensure your iOS deployment target is 15.0 or higher, as this library relies on the Apple MusicKit, which requires iOS 15.0+.
- Add the following line to your info.plist file to include a description for the Media Library usage permission:
```
<key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow to continue</string>
```
- Ensure that your Apple Developer account has the MusicKit entitlement enabled and the appropriate MusicKit capabilities are set in your app's bundle identifier.

## Linking

As of React Native `> 0.61`, auto linking should work for iOS. There shouldn't be any modifications necessary and it _Should_ work out of the box.
